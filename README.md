# minishell
Minishell is a simplified UNIX shell implemented as part of the 42 School curriculum. It replicates essential features of Bash, such as command execution, piping, redirections, environment variable management, and built-in commands. This project is an in-depth exploration of process management, file descriptors, and parsing logic in C.
